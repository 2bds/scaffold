# Scaffold
<br>Development Environment

### SDK:
<br>Currently provide Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 support only.
<br>Uncompress sdk libraries' 7z archives and make directory structure as following:
<div align=left>
<img width="198" height="417" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xurendong/scaffold/master/IMG/sdk_directory_structure.png" alt="recommend directory structure"/>
</div>
<br>Set the SDKDIR_PATH value of other project's main CMakeLists.txt file to your  ...SDK\GitHub\VS2017 path.
<br>You'd better recompile these sdk libraries under your development environment.
